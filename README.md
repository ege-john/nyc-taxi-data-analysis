# NYC Taxi Data Analysis 🚕 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes NYC taxi trip data, processes CSV files, calculates statistics, applies sorting algorithms, and builds a graph representation of taxi zones and trip frequencies. It also uses DFS/BFS to analyze connectivity.

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Data Processing & Statistics
- Reads and extracts key trip data fields.
- Computes trip statistics (min, max, avg).
- Filters and calculates valid speed values.

### Task 2: Sorting Algorithms & Performance
- Implements multiple sorting methods (Merge, Bubble, Heap and QuickSort).
- Sorts trip data by time and speed.
- Compares sorting efficiency through execution time.

### Task 3: Graph Construction & Analysis
- Builds a graph with taxi zones and trip connections.
- Uses DFS, BFS, and NetworkX to find components.
- Visualizes trip frequency through graphs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 
- **Python** (Data Processing & Algorithms)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **NetworkX** (Graph Processing)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
