# NYC Taxi Data Analysis 🚕 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes NYC taxi trip data, processes CSV files, calculates statistics, applies sorting algorithms, and builds a graph representation of taxi zones and trip frequencies. It also uses DFS/BFS to analyze connectivity.

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Data Processing & Statistics Calculation
- Reads taxi trip data from CSV files.
- Extracts relevant fields like `passenger_count`, `pickup/dropoff times`, and `location IDs`.
- Computes **minimum, maximum, and average values** for trip statistics.
- Filters valid speed values and calculates **average, minimum, and maximum speeds**.

### Task 2: Sorting Algorithms & Performance Measurement
- Implements **Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, QuickSort, and HeapSort**.
- Sorts trip data based on different fields (e.g., time, speed).
- Measures execution time for sorting algorithms to compare efficiency.

### Task 3: Graph Construction & Traversal
- Builds a graph using **taxi zones as nodes** and **trip counts as weighted edges**.
- Uses **DFS, BFS, and NetworkX** to analyze connected components.
- Visualizes the graph and compares traversal performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 
- **Python** (Data Processing & Algorithms)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **NetworkX** (Graph Processing)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
