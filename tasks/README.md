# Tasks

## Task 1: Data Processing & Statistics Calculation
- Reads taxi trip data from CSV files.
- Extracts relevant fields like `passenger_count`, `pickup/dropoff times`, and `location IDs`.
- Computes **minimum, maximum, and average values** for trip statistics.
- Filters valid speed values and calculates **average, minimum, and maximum speeds**.

## Task 2: Sorting Algorithms & Performance Measurement
- Implements **Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, QuickSort, and HeapSort**.
- Sorts trip data based on different fields (e.g., time, speed).
- Measures execution time for sorting algorithms to compare efficiency.

## Task 3: Graph Construction & Traversal
- Builds a graph using **taxi zones as nodes** and **trip counts as weighted edges**.
- Uses **DFS, BFS, and NetworkX** to analyze connected components.
- Visualizes the graph and compares traversal performance.
